BUFFALO LAND 
BY OUR TAMMANY SACHEM 

THERE S A WONDERFUL LAND FAR OUT IN THE WEST 
WELL WORTHY A VISIT  MY FRIEND 
THERE  PURITANS THOUGHT  AS THE SUN WENT TO REST 
CREATION ITSELF HAD AN END 
 T IS A WILD  WEIRD SPOT ON THE CONTINENT S FACE 
A WOUND WHICH IS GHASTLY AND RED 
WHERE THE SAVAGES WRITE THE DEEDS OF THEIR RACE
IN BLOOD THAT THEY CONSTANTLY SHED 
THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD THE FAIR PRAIRIES DEFACE 
AND STAMP IT THE KINGDOM OF DREAD 

THE EMIGRANT TRAIL IS A SKELETON PATH 
YOU MEASURE ITS MILES BY THE BONES 
THERE SAVAGES STRUCK  IN THEIR MERCILESS WRATH 
AND NOW  AFTER SUNSET  THE MOANS 
WHEN TEMPESTS ARE OUT  FILL THE SHUDDERING AIR 
AND GHOSTS FLIT THE WAGONS BESIDE 
AND POINT TO THE SKULLS LYING GRINNING AND BARE
AND BEG OF THE TEAMSTERS A RIDE 
SOMETIMES  T IS A FATHER WITH SNOW ON HIS HAIR 
AGAIN   T IS A YOUTH AND HIS BRIDE 

WHAT VISIONS OF HORROR EACH VALLEY COULD TELL 
IF PROVIDENCE GAVE IT A TONGUE 
HOW OFTEN ITS EDEN WAS CHANGED TO A HELL 
IN WHICH A WHOLE TRAIN HAD BEEN FLUNG 
 VIII HOW DEATH CRY AND BATTLE SHOUT FRIGHTENED THE BIRDS 
AND PRAYERS WERE AS THICK AS THE LEAVES 
AND NO ONE TO CATCH THE POOR DYING ONE S WORDS
BUT DEATH  AS HE GATHERED HIS SHEAVES 
YOU SEE THE BONES BLEACHING AMONG THE WILD HERDS 
IN SHROUDS THAT THE FIELD SPIDER WEAVES 

THAT ERA IS PASSINGANOTHER ONE COMES 
THE ERA OF STEAM AND THE PLOW 
WITH CLANGOR OF COMMERCE AND FACTORY HUMS 
WHERE ONLY THE WIGWAM IS NOW 
LIKE MIST OF THE MORNING BEFORE THE BRIGHT SUN 
THE CLOUD FROM THE LAND DISAPPEARS 
THE SPIRIT OF MURDER HIS CIRCLE HAS RUN
AND FLED FROM THE MARCH OF THE YEARS 
THE CLICK OF MACHINE DROWNS THE CLICK OF THE GUN 
AND DAY HIDES THE NIGHT TIME OF TEARS 
 IX 

PREFACE 
THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO MAKE THE READER BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THAT WILD LAND WHICH HE HAS KNOWN FROM CHILDHOOD  AS THE HOME OF THE INDIAN AND THE BUFFALO  THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHAIN  DISTORTED AND RUGGED  HAS BEEN APTLY CALLED THE COLOSSAL VERTEBR   OF OUR CONTINENT S BROAD BACK  AND FROM THENCE  AS A LINE  THE PLAINS  WEIRD AND WONDERFUL  STRETCH EASTWARD THROUGH COLORADO  AND EMBRACE THE ENTIRE WESTERN HALF OF KANSAS 

FORTUNE  NOT LONG SINCE  THREW IN MY WAY AN INVITATION  WHICH I GLADLY ACCEPTED  TO JOIN A SEMI SCIENTIFIC PARTY  SINCE SOMEWHAT KNOWN TO FAME THROUGH VARIOUS ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER PRESS  IN A SOJOURN OF SEVERAL MONTHS ON THE GREAT PLAINS  AT A MEETING HELD WITH DUE SOLEMNITY ON THE EVE OF STARTING  THE PROFESSOR  TO WHOM THE READER WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE PROPER CONNECTION  WAS CHOSEN LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION  WHILE TO MY LOT FELL THE X  OFFICE OF EDITOR OF THE FUTURE RECORD  OR RATHER GRAND SCRIBE OF WHAT WE WERE PLEASED TO CALL OUR  LOG BOOK   THE LATTER NOW LIES BEFORE ME  IN ALL ITS GLORY OF SHABBY COVERS AND DIRTY PAGES  ITS SOILED FACE IS AS HONORABLE AS THAT OF THE LABORER WHO COMES FROM HIS TASK IN A WELL HARVESTED FIELD  OUT OF THE SHEAVES GATHERED DURING OUR JOURNEY  I SHALL TRY AND TAKE SUCH PORTIONS AS MAY BEST SUPPLY THE MENTAL CRAVINGS OF THE COUNTLESS THOUSANDS WHO HUNGER FOR THE LIFE AND THE LORE OF THE FAR WEST 

I HAVE GIVEN THE MISTAKES AS WELL AS TRIUMPHS OF OUR EXPEDITION  AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY WILL READILY RECOGNIZE THEIR FAMILIAR CAMP NAMES  THE DISGUISE WILL PROBABLY BE PLEASANT  AS FEW LIKE TO SEE THEIR FAILURES ON PUBLIC PARADE  PREFERRING RATHER TO LEAVE THESE IN BARRACKS  AND LET THEIR SUCCESSES ONLY APPEAR AT REVIEW 

THE PLAINS HAVE A FACE  A PEOPLE  AND A BRUTE CREATION  PECULIARLY THEIR OWN  AND TO THESE OUR PARTY DEVOTED EARNEST STUDY  THE EXPEDITION PRESENTED A RARE OPPORTUNITY OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH THE GAME OF THE COUNTRY  AND  IN WRITING THE PRESENT VOLUME  MY AIM HAS BEEN TO MAKE IT SO FAR A TEXT BOOK FOR AMATEUR HUNTERS THAT THEY MAY BECOME AT ONCE CONVERSANT WITH THE HABITS OF THE GAME  AND THE BEST MANNER OF KILLING IT  THE TIME IS NOT FAR DISTANT  WHEN THE PLAINS AND THE ROCKY XI  MOUNTAINS WILL BE SOUGHT BY THOUSANDS ANNUALLY  AS A FAVORITE FIELD FOR SPORT AND RECREATION 

ANOTHER AND STILL LARGER CLASS  IT IS HOPED  WILL FIND MUCH OF INTEREST AND VALUE IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES  FROM EVERY STATE IN THE UNION  PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING WESTWARD  WE FOUND EMIGRANT WAGONS ON SPOTS FROM WHICH THE INDIANS HAD JUST REMOVED THEIR WIGWAMS  MULTITUDES MORE ARE NOW ON THE WAY  WITH THE EARNEST PURPOSE OF FOUNDING HOMES AND  IF POSSIBLE  OF FINDING FORTUNES  IN ORDER TO AID THIS CLASS  AS WELL AS THE SPORTSMAN  I HAVE GATHERED IN AN APPENDIX SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS MAY BE USEFUL TO BOTH 

THE SCIENTIFIC DETAILS OF OUR TRIP WILL PROBABLY BE PUBLISHED IN PROPER FORM AND TIME  BY THE SAVANS INTERESTED  IN REGARD TO THESE  MY OBJECT HAS BEEN SIMPLY TO CHRONICLE SUCH MATTERS AS MADE AN IMPRESSION UPON MY OWN MIND  BEING CONTENT WITH WHAT CREAM MIGHT BE GATHERED BY AN AMATEUR S SKIMMING  WHILE THE MORE BULKY MILK SHOULD BE SAVED IN CAPACIOUS SCIENTIFIC BUCKETS 

PROFESSOR COPE  THE WELL KNOWN NATURALIST  OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES  PHILADELPHIA  RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION AND CLASSIFICATION THE MOST VALUABLE FOSSILS WE OBTAINED  AND TO HIM I AM INDEBTED FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE XII  SCIENTIFIC MATTER  WHICH WILL BE FOUND EMBODIED IN CHAPTERS TWENTY THIRD AND TWENTY FOURTH 

THE ILLUSTRATIONS OF MEN AND BRUTES IN THIS WORK ARE STUDIES FROM LIFE  WHENEVER IT WAS POSSIBLE  WE HAD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN 

THE PLAINS  IT MUST BE SAID  ARE A TRACT WITH WHICH ROMANCE HAS HAD MUCH MORE TO DO THAN HISTORY  RED MEN  BRAVE AND CHIVALROUS  AND UNNATURAL BUFFALO  WITH THE HABITS OF LIONS  EXIST ONLY IN IMAGINATION  IN THESE PAGES  MY EARNEST ENDEAVOR  WHEN DEALING WITH ACTUALITIES  HAS BEEN TO  HOLD THE MIRROR UP TO NATURE   AND TO DESCRIBE MEN  MANNERS  AND THINGS AS THEY ARE IN REAL LIFE UPON THE FRONTIERS  AND BEYOND  TO DAY
